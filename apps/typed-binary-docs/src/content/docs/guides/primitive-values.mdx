There are a few primitives to choose from:

- `bool` is an 8-bit value representing either `true` or `false`.
  - Encoded as `1` if true, and as `0` if false.
- `byte` is an 8-bit value representing an unsigned number between 0 and 255.
  - Encoded as-is
- `i32` is a 32-bit signed integer number container.
  - Encoded as-is
- `f32` is a 32-bit signed floating-point number container.
  - Encoded as-is
- `string` is a variable-length string of ASCII characters.
  - A string of characters followed by a `\0` terminal character.

```ts
import { BufferWriter, BufferReader, byte, string } from 'typed-binary';

const buffer = Buffer.alloc(16);

// Writing four bytes into the buffer
const writer = new BufferWriter(buffer);
byte.write(writer, 'W'.charCodeAt(0));
byte.write(writer, 'o'.charCodeAt(0));
byte.write(writer, 'w'.charCodeAt(0));
byte.write(writer, 0);

const reader = new BufferReader(buffer);
console.log(string.read(reader)); // > Wow
```
