title: Recursive Types
description: A guide on how to describe recursive types in Typed Binary
---

If you want an object type to be able to contain one of itself (recursion), then you have to start using **keyed** types. The basic pattern is this:

```ts
/**
 * Wrapping a schema with a 'bin.keyed' call allows the inner code to
 * use a reference to the type we're currently creating, instead
 * of the type itself.
 *
 * The reference variable 'Recursive' doesn't have to be called
 * the same as the actual variable we're storing the schema in,
 * but it's a neat trick that makes the schema code more readable.
 *
 * The 'recursive-key' has to uniquely identify this type in this tree.
 * There may be other distinct types using the same key, as long as they do
 * not interact with each other (one doesn't contain the other).
 * This is because references are resolved recursively once the method
 * passed as the 2nd argument to 'keyed' returns the schema.
 */
const Recursive = bin.keyed('recursive-key', (Recursive) =>
  bin.object({
    value: bin.i32,
    next: bin.optional(Recursive),
  })
);
```

### Recursive types alongside generics

```ts
import bin from 'typed-binary';

const Expression = bin.keyed('expression', (Expression) =>
  bin.generic(
    {},
    {
      multiply: bin.object({
        a: Expression,
        b: Expression,
      }),
      negate: bin.object({
        inner: Expression,
      }),
      int_literal: bin.object({
        value: bin.i32,
      }),
    }
  )
);

type Expression = bin.Parsed<typeof Expression>;

const expr: Expression = {
  type: 'multiply',
  a: {
    type: 'negate',
    inner: {
      type: 'int_literal',
      value: 15,
    },
  },
  b: {
    type: 'int_literal',
    value: 2,
  },
};
```
