title: Typed Arrays
description: A guide on how typed arrays can be represented in Typed Binary
---

Sometimes binary is the format that we want to work with directly. [Typed array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Typed_arrays) schemas
allow that data to be nested in plain objects or arrays.

```ts
const Image = bin.object({
  size: bin.tupleOf([bin.u32, bin.u32]),
  bitmap: bin.u8Array(256 * 256),
});

// {
//   size: [number, number];
//   bitmap: Uint8Array;
// }
const image = Image.read(...);

image.size // [number, number]
image.bitmap // Uint8Array
```

Below is the list of available typed array schemas.

Schema constructor | Encoded as | JavaScript value
---|---|---
`bin.u8Array` | consecutive 8-bit unsigned integers | `Uint8Array`
`bin.u8ClampedArray` | consecutive 8-bit unsigned integers | `Uint8ClampedArray`
`bin.u16Array` | consecutive 16-bit unsigned integers | `Uint16Array`
`bin.u32Array` | consecutive 32-bit unsigned integers | `Uint32Array`
`bin.i8Array` | consecutive 8-bit signed integers | `Int8Array`
`bin.i16Array` | consecutive 16-bit signed integers | `Int16Array`
`bin.i32Array` | consecutive 32-bit signed integers | `Int32Array`
`bin.f32Array` | consecutive 32-bit floats | `Float32Array`
`bin.f64Array` | consecutive 64-bit floats | `Float64Array`
