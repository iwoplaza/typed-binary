title: Why Typed Binary?
description: Here is how Typed Binary can be used in your project, and what its strength are.
---

**Typed Binary** introduces a composable TypeScript API for defining how JavaScript values are encoded into binary, and decoded from binary.
No need for manual type definitions or an external DSL.
Schemas themselves define what type they encode and decode, and **your IDE knows it**!


#### Customizable, with good defaults

Schemas can be simple primitives (integers, floats, null-terminated strings, and many more) or compositions
in the form of arrays or objects. Custom schema types can also be made to further customize the encoding and
decoding.

#### Binary protocols no longer a last resort

**Typed Binary** aims to be environment agnostic, so schemas can be shared between the server and client to easily transport
compact binary packets when the network bandwith is of utmost importance.
